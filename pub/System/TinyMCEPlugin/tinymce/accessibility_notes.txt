Accessibility required plugins

To get tab working well, enable the tabfocus plugin.  The following seems to be a good combination.
 
   tabfocus_elements: ':prev,:next',
    plugins : 'tabfocus',


Translations are stored in the theme under the accessibility comment.

The application will use a default aria label of Rich Text Area, or derive it from the defining element if it was specified there. 

Known Issues

Use Voice Over to move voice cursor and focus into TinyMCE and then tab or shift-tab out and back into the editor. The keyboard focus moves but the voice over focus does not. Probably should be in sync?

ToDo
====

Probably want to make a way of doing editor short cuts.
Should remove the shortcut text from the button titles as it makes it JAWS read things like "Bold left paren, control plus B, right paren, button". Better to put shortcuts in a single help document.

perhaps in the tinymce init settings have something like:
shortcuts : { 'ctrl-b', 'bold'} 

need navigation.

highlighting on navigation

Provide better visualisation of focussed toolbar buttons (probably change the background color).  Use :focus and :active pseudo-classes in CSS.
Currently we use role="button" for all buttons.  For alignment should we use radio groups? For bold/italic/etc should we use checkboxes? Current behaviour matches CK but doesn't provide audible feedback on if the button is pressed or not (despite setting the aria-pressed attribute)

Provide an icon for the accessibility help dialog (so that user's have a chance of reaching it if the alt-0 shortcut conflicts with something).


Done
====

alt-f10 to go to the toolbar (but with issues caused by the tabfocus plugin as noted above)

Keyboard navigation through toolbar items (arrow keys). Tab moves to editor.

Fake combo boxes and split buttons now work with both JAWS and voice over.  Strictly speaking the comboboxes are treated as popup buttons because role="combobox" just doesn't work anywhere properly.

iFrame needs a keyboard shortcut to enable accessibility help. Also need to provide the accessibility help.
